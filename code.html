                        <p>
                            The orange, also called sweet orange to distinguish it from the bitter orange (Citrus × aurantium), is the fruit of a
                        tree in the family Rutaceae. Botanically, this is the hybrid Citrus × sinensis, between the pomelo (Citrus maxima) and
                        the mandarin orange (Citrus reticulata). The chloroplast genome, and therefore the maternal line, is that of pomelo.
                        There are many related hybrids including of mandarins and sweet orange. The sweet orange has had its full genome
                        sequenced.

                    <h1>Apple</h1>
                    <p>
                        An apple is a round, edible fruit produced by an apple tree (Malus spp., among them the domestic or orchard apple; Malus
                    domestica). Apple trees are cultivated worldwide and are the most widely grown species in the genus Malus. The tree
                    originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor, Malus sieversii, is still found. Apples have been grown for
                    thousands of years in Eurasia and were introduced to North America by European colonists. Apples have religious and
                    mythological significance in many cultures, including Norse, Greek, and European Christian tradition.
